This story sounds crazy but it's true.
From the first day i left school, i knew i had to go into programming. I felt sad that after 5 years in the University, we didn't do anything as regards programming.
After one month plus, i went into this journey of Coding through web design. I didnt know that time, but web design is a very good way to start. It was at Code Lagos- Yaba, Lagos
So we started with HTML/CSS which we did for some weeks and i enjoyed so much. WE DIDNT DO JAVASCRIPT. I felt javascript would be a ball in the park for me like HTML and CSS was.

|At the end we were given so many javascript videos. This was 2018. Instead of checking all the materials, i downladed a javascript book which i was reading and i enjoyed
the first few chapters. The Javascript DOM part was in the eight chapter so i never got there before given up like 6 times. I ususlly give up in the Higher order part.
So i was confuse as to how javascript made things  work on website. So i didnt touch javascipt, i went into python.


Fastforward to now, after three years i found a very useful video, which would have really helped in understanding the usefullness. Its the video that guided me to this work

making this work very special....delay is not denial, cheers to growth!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
